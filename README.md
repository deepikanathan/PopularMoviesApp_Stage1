# PopularMoviesApp_Stage1

## Project Overview
This app is developed as part of a graducation requirement for Android Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It allows users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. This app allows users to discover the most popular movies playing. The development of this app is split in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1.
In this stage, I built the core experience of the movies app.

## This app will:
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
- The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date

## Why this Project?
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. I honed these fundamental skills in this project. This app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## Technical Concepts learnt in this project
- fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
